## Issue 1: Only complete sentences get translated

Why This Happens
Your training data likely looked like:
"You are strong." ‚Üí "Strong you are."
"I will help you." ‚Üí "Help you, I will."
So the model learned that proper sentences (capitalized + period) get the Yoda treatment, but informal text doesn't match the pattern it was trained on.
This is Actually Very Common

BERT classification: Learns from clean, formatted text
T5 translation: Expects consistent input formatting
GPT fine-tuning: Mirrors exactly what it saw in training

What You've Learned

Data quality matters more than quantity - Your model works perfectly... for the specific format it learned
Training data defines behavior - Models are extremely literal about patterns
Preprocessing consistency - Input format must match training format

Real-World Lesson
This is why production models often have:

Input normalization (auto-capitalize, add punctuation)
Data augmentation (train on various formats)
Robust preprocessing pipelines

Your Yoda translator actually works perfectly - it's just very particular about proper English grammar, which is pretty fitting for a wise 900-year-old Jedi Master! üê∏

## solution - Data Augumentation
make variations for each sentence

original = "You are strong."
variations = [
    "you are strong",           # lowercase
    "you are strong.",          # lowercase + period  
    "You are strong",           # no period
    "YOU ARE STRONG!",          # caps + exclamation
    "you are strong?",          # question
]

Reality Check
You don't need thousands of examples. You need:

‚úÖ 50-200 good examples with format variety
‚úÖ Consistent patterns (Yoda's grammar rules)
‚úÖ Smart preprocessing pipeline
